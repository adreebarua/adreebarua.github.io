            <h1>This is my essay!</h1>
            <h1>73rd & 74th Street</h1>
            <P>The first time I went to Jackson Heights was in August of 2015. Nearly two months after coming to New York City, I went to Jackson Heights for a haircut. It was a busy, sunny, and noisy Sunday morning, I didn’t even know where I was, I just knew that I was there to get a haircut. A couple of months later, I went to Jackson Heights for the second time, it was again to get a haircut. It was the same busy, chaotic, and noisy 74th Street, with cars honking next to the pizza store, someone double parked on a narrow road, the sound of the Seven Train breezing away, kids were shouting, adults were shopping, all the things that still exist in Jackson Heights to this day and something that probably made Jackson Heights the place it is today. Jackson Heights reminds of Bangladesh, India, and other South Asian countries. A small chunk of Queens is home to so many Bengali people, South Asian food, clothing, games, and culture. It just goes to show that New York City is big and broad, but there's always a small place in New York that’s your own.</P>
            <p>It’s a very unique part of New York. Just two blocks of Queens, 73rd and 74th Street, hold so much passion and dedication of the workers, fun and enjoyment for the people that go shopping, and hold a sense of home for people like me who go there every week. The entrance of 73rd Street is home to Apna Bazar. The middle of 74th Street is home to Patel Brothers. These stores have been there for decades and they are similar to the Costcos of New York City. I have been to these stores hundreds of times and thousands of people go there every day because of their nature. For instance, walking through the store, hearing some classical Hindi music, looking at delicious Indian snacks, tons of species, and various foods all around me makes me feel like I am in India. In short, any major food you can find in South Asian countries, you will find here too. When you get out of the grocery store, you will be hit with the smell of other delicious cuisines constantly being made every 10 feet of the block. From Ittadi Garden to Raja Sweets, if you walk into these stores, you will once again be greeted with Indian style dining, the smell of flavorful Indian cuisine floating in the air, and mouth watering desserts. Once again, the food of Jackson Heights is over the top good and has tons of South Asian flavor which is something that makes the place so special.</p>
            <p>When I came here from Bangladesh, I couldn’t have imagined how similar Jackson Heights would be to the country I am leaving behind. For example, one time, I remember walking through 74th Street and seeing the sign of Aarong, a clothing store that I remember from Bangladesh, and seeing a carrom board which I remember from India, and seeing tons of sarees on display, which you will find everywhere in South Asia. Jackson Heights also creates a welcoming environment during the time of holidays. For example, on days like Diwali, there are decorations on the streets next to Roosevelt Avenue. Sometimes, there would be celebrations for Durga Puja, and other times, there would be tons of small shops that temporarily open, selling a lot of traditional Bengali items. Cultural aspects like these are what connect these roads to an entire region of the world. In addition, one time in Jackson Heights I also saw a Cricket Bat. Cricket is extremely popular in India and it is the second most popular sport in the world. Despite this, it’s very rare in America and that moment was the first time I saw a Cricket Bat in roughly seven years. Jackson Heights is filled with stores like these home to typical Indian products which takes me back to the memories of my childhood.</p>
            <p>Overall, Jackson Heights is an incredible, unique, and diverse place. 73rd and 74th Streets of Queens, NY is home to countless people, but it is also a special place for so many others because they find it their own. Just like Jackson Heights for me, there are hundreds of places in New York that belong to different people, they just have to find it, and enjoy it.</p>
